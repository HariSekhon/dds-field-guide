As described in the section on continuous deployment servers, running automated tests on each deploy or commit is an important way to ensure software quality.

## Tools

The following table lists testing tools you're likely to encounter:

* [CasperJS](http://casperjs.org/).  "CasperJS is an open source navigation scripting and testing utility written in Javascript for the PhantomJS WebKit headless browser and SlimerJS (Gecko). It eases the process of defining a full navigation scenario and provides useful high-level functions, methods, and syntactic sugar for doing common tasks."
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/). "PhantomJS is a headless WebKit scriptable with a JavaScript API. "
* [Canned](https://github.com/sideshowcoder/canned). "Server to respond with fake API responses by using a directory of files for finding out what to say."
* [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org). "Selenium automates browsers. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that."
