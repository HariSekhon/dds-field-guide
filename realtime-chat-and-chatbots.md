# Realtime chat and chatbots

<span class="drop fa fa-comments fa-5x pull-left fa-border"></span>

Once considered a relic of a bygone era, realtime chat systems are a huge part of the workflow of most distributed teams.  Like texting, chat allows developers to send each other messages in realtime, and is the place where most routine team communication takes place.  (It can be the place where the team culture is formed and maintained.)

In addition to human participants, team chats can include a "chatbot," which is a program that perform useful functions by monitoring the chatroom for special commands.  The chatbot, which appears like anyone else in the room, can do routine tasks like kicking off a build, locking the production server, reporting errors from the monitoring tools, or providing man pages.  And, programmer being programmers, the chatbot can also do things that reflect the culture of the team, like showing pictures of a Pug, displaying a squirrel whenever you type "ship it," or providing responses in a "Magic Eightball" form when you ask it questions.  In general, the chatbot will reflect the culture of the team that's using it.
